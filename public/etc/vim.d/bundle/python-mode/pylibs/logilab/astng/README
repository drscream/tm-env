ASTNG
=====

What's this ?
-------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
governed by pylint's needs.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast` module.
It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively
walking down the AST and building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). The
new node classes have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
They include some support for static inference and local name scopes.
Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.

Main modules are:

* `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
  different type of nodes of the tree.

* the `manager` contains a high level object to get astng trees from
  source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
  constructed tree for quick access


Installation
------------

Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run ::

Test
----

Tests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suite
at once, you may use the 'pytest' utility from logilab-common (simply
type 'pytest' from within this directory) or if you're running python
>= 2.7, using discover, for instance::

  python -m unittest discover -p "unittest*.py"
