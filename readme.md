# tm-env, or my personal new dot environment

I desided to create a new dot environment from my old dot environment
and from many new cool environments i found on the internet. I'm not
sure if it is interesting for other people, but i like to share it on
github.

## some random information

I using the bash as shell, i know many people who like to use zsh,
because it "should" be so much easier and intuitive to use. But i
desided to use bash, because it's installed on many servers i 
connected to.

For editing files nothing is better than vim, so there are many
plugins, config parameters in this repository.
